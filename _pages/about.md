Currently diving deep into Applied Statistics as a second-year Masterâ€™s student at the [University of Michigan](www.umich.edu/), Ann Arbor, where I spend most of my time turning chaotic data into clean stories (and occasionally questioning my life choices during late-night debugging ðŸ¤¯).

I graduated with First-Class Honours in Mathematics with Finance from the  [University of Liverpool](www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in July 2024 â€” which means Iâ€™ve been crunching numbers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Right now, Iâ€™m working in Dr. Emily Bricenoâ€™s lab, where we explore cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment, and cross-national measurement challenges through large-scale datasets like HCAP. My work bridges data wrangling, statistical modeling, and real-world questions in global health and neuropsychology â€” and I love every messy, complex minute of it.

Beyond the numbers, I enjoy visualizing data, collaborating across disciplines, and asking way too many questions. If you're working on something exciting â€” especially involving human behavior, global health, or machine learning for social good â€” letâ€™s connect!
