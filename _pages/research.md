Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on several research projects that span statistics, cognitive science, and global health. These experiences have strengthened my skills in data wrangling, statistical modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration ‚Äî and deepened my curiosity for using data to answer real-world questions.

I‚Äôm currently working with Professor Emily Briceno at the University of Michigan, where our team focuses on cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cross-cultural neuropsychological assessment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. My role includes data cleaning, variable harmonization, modeling cognitive outcomes, and navigating the complexities of large, multi-country studies.

More details on past and current projects are listed below. Stay tuned ‚Äî I‚Äôm always exploring new directions.

## üá≥üáµ Nepal Cognitive Aging & MCI Assessment  
(with [Prof. Emily Briceno](https://experts.umich.edu/4331-emily-briceno) and [Prof. Dirgha Jibi Ghimire](https://psc.isr.umich.edu/profile/ghimire-dirgha-jibi/))

**Overview:** 
This project focuses on the **adaptation of neuropsychological assessments** for **low-literacy populations** in Nepal. Specifically, we aim to culturally and linguistically adapt two cognitive tests: a **visuospatial construction and visual memory task (Constructional Praxis)** and the **Symbol Cancellation test**, ensuring accessibility, validity, and reliability in underserved settings.

**My Contributions:**  
- Led the adaptation and scoring strategy refinement for Constructional Praxis and Symbol Cancellation tasks based on field protocols and response characteristics  
- Cleaned and harmonized raw test data from interviewer-administered paper forms and digital entry  
- Developed logic rules for identifying **‚Äúnot assessed‚Äù vs. true 0 scores** under conditions of illiteracy or visual/motor limitation  
- Coordinated data integration with HCAP frameworks and harmonized Nepal-specific codebooks with U.S. and Mexico counterparts  
- Built reproducible R scripts for tracking missingness, scoring distributions, and variable creation across subtests

**Skills/Tools:** R, neuropsychological test coding, missing data management, HCAP harmonization, cross-cultural measurement

## üß† HRS-HCAP Mild Cognitive Impairment Modeling  
(with [Prof. Emily Briceno](https://experts.umich.edu/4331-emily-briceno), [Prof. Zachary J Kunicki](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/zkunicki) and [Prof. Miguel Arce Renter√≠a](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/miguel-arce-renteria-phd) )

**Overview:**  
Using data from the **U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS-HCAP)**, this project investigates **risk factors and diagnostic pathways** for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among older adults. We analyze associations between demographic, medical, and psychological factors and MCI subtypes (with and without memory impairment).

**My Contributions:**  
- Conducted **data cleaning and integration** from HRS core files and HCAP cognitive batteries, with attention to longitudinal structure and variable alignment  
- Created derived variables (e.g., MCI subtype classification, CESD-based depression status, combined race/ethnicity categories)  
- Fit and interpreted **multinomial logistic regression models** to predict cognitive status across three groups: Normal, MCI w/ memory impairment, MCI w/o memory impairment  
- Generated **publication-ready summary tables and plots**, including stacked bar charts and model coefficient visualizations  

**Skills/Tools:** R (dplyr, ggplot2, nnet), multinomial logistic regression, variable engineering, large-scale survey data handling, reproducible reporting  


## üêÅ Digital Cages Behavioral Data Analysis (with [Prof. Ivo D. Dinov](https://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/ivo-d-dinov) and Dr. [Simeone Marino](https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/2984/simeone-marino) ) 

**Overview:**  
This project explores high-resolution **actigraphy data** collected from mice housed in ‚Äúdigital cages‚Äù ‚Äî an automated platform that passively captures movement-based behavioral patterns. Our aim is to identify **distinct activity profiles** and uncover **latent behavioral states** under varying experimental conditions.

**My Contributions:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed large-scale time-series datasets, including timestamp alignment, sensor noise filtering, and missing value imputation  
- Applied **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize behavioral trajectories across individuals  
- Performed **unsupervised clustering** (k-means, hierarchical) to identify natural groupings in activity patterns  
- Integrated **feature selection pipelines** using the NExOS algorithm for downstream supervised learning and behavioral prediction  

**Skills/Tools:** R, Python, data wrangling, PCA/UMAP, clustering, time-series analysis, scientific visualization  


## üÖøÔ∏è Algorithmic and Graph-Theoretic Analysis of Parking Functions  
**Advisor:** [Dr. Thomas Selig](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ThomasSelig)  
**Institution:** Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University  
**Date:** Jun. 2024 ‚Äì Aug. 2024

**Overview:**  
This project explores the **combinatorial and graph-theoretic structures underlying parking functions**, a classic object in enumerative combinatorics. Using tools such as **bipartite matchings**, **adjacency matrices**, and **friendship graphs**, we analyzed recurrence relations and structural properties of parking function families.

**My Contributions:**  
- Applied graph-theoretic methods to characterize and classify parking functions  
- Developed a simulation framework in **Python** using `NetworkX` and `NumPy`, enabling large-scale testing and model validation  
- Proposed novel multi-agent parking algorithms with **~40% improvement** in computational efficiency over standard methods  
- Conducted over **100,000 simulation trials** and visualized patterns using `Matplotlib`  
- Co-authored a manuscript in preparation, formalizing connections between parking functions and graph-based optimization  

**Skills/Tools:** Python, NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, graph theory, combinatorics, algorithm design
