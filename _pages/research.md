Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on several research projects that span statistics, cognitive science, and global health. These experiences have strengthened my skills in data wrangling, statistical modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration ‚Äî and deepened my curiosity for using data to answer real-world questions.

I‚Äôm currently working with Professor Emily Briceno at the University of Michigan, where our team focuses on cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cross-cultural neuropsychological assessment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. My role includes data cleaning, variable harmonization, modeling cognitive outcomes, and navigating the complexities of large, multi-country studies.

More details on past and current projects are listed below. Stay tuned ‚Äî I‚Äôm always exploring new directions.

- Cleaned and harmonized raw test data from interviewer-administered paper forms and digital entry  
- Developed logic rules for identifying **‚Äúnot assessed‚Äù vs. true 0 scores** under conditions of illiteracy or visual/motor limitation  
- Coordinated data integration with HCAP frameworks and harmonized Nepal-specific codebooks with U.S. and Mexico counterparts  
- Built reproducible R scripts for tracking missingness, scoring distributions, and variable creation across subtests

**Skills/Tools:** R, neuropsychological test coding, missing data management, HCAP harmonization, cross-cultural measurement

**Overview:**  
Using data from the **U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS-HCAP)**, this project investigates **risk factors and diagnostic pathways** for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among older adults.

**Overview:**  
This project explores high-resolution **actigraphy data** collected from mice housed in ‚Äúdigital cages‚Äù ‚Äî an automated platform that passively captures movement-based behavioral patterns. Our aim is to identify **distinct activity profiles** and uncover **latent behavioral states** under varying experimental conditions.

**My Contributions:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed large-scale time-series datasets, including timestamp alignment, sensor noise filtering, and missing value imputation  
- Applied **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize behavioral trajectories across individuals

- Integrated **feature selection pipelines** using the NExOS algorithm for downstream supervised learning and behavioral prediction  

**Skills/Tools:** R, Python, data wrangling, PCA/UMAP, clustering, time-series analysis, scientific visualization  


## üÖøÔ∏è Algorithmic and Graph-Theoretic Analysis of Parking Functions  
**Advisor:** [Dr. Thomas Selig](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ThomasSelig)  
**Institution:** Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University  
**Date:** Jun. 2024 ‚Äì Aug. 2024

**Overview:**  
This project explores the **combinatorial and graph-theoretic structures underlying parking functions**, a classic object in enumerative combinatorics. Using tools such as **bipartite matchings**, **adjacency matrices**, and **friendship graphs**, we analyzed recurrence relations and structural properties of parking function families.

**My Contributions:**  
- Applied graph-theoretic methods to characterize and classify parking functions  
- Developed a simulation framework in **Python** using `NetworkX` and `NumPy`, enabling large-scale testing and model validation  
- Proposed novel multi-agent parking algorithms with **~40% improvement** in computational efficiency over standard methods  
- Conducted over **100,000 simulation trials** and visualized patterns using `Matplotlib`  
- Co-authored a manuscript in preparation, formalizing connections between parking functions and graph-based optimization  

**Skills/Tools:** Python, NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, graph theory, combinatorics, algorithm design

## Determination of Average Time that A Particle Escapes from a Channel with Diverse Parameters

**Abstract:** As a particle bounces within a macroscopic billiard table, microstructures affect the frequency of output angles. There also exists a connection between macrostructures and microstructures, both of which determining particle behavior, which we quantify as the mean escape time. In the case of a microstructure that introduces specular diffuse collision law, the mean escape time is reminiscent of martingales and optional stopping theorem. With triangular microgeometry, the output angles are finite. We begin to construct the transition matrix which models the behavior of these output angles, and define the ways in which the angles transform within the triangular cells.

This research was completed at Summer 2021 REU at Mount Holyoke College with Ruozhen Gong and Emily Rosaci, under the mentorship of [Professor Timothy Chumley](https://tchumley.mtholyoke.edu/?_ga=2.98059675.564660943.1704846727-1838912408.1704846727). Our group wrote a [final report](https://tchumley.mtholyoke.edu/pdf/Summer_2021_research_report.pdf) and built an [R-shiny app](https://olypys-yuxuan-wang.shinyapps.io/Billiards_Probability_and_their_Interplay/) to showcase our results.

## Leveraging Financial News Analysis to Predict Stock Price Movement

**Abstract:** Stock market predictions have been prominent among scholars. Sentiment analysis applying financial news articles for predicting stock has also grown in popularity over the past few decades. Our research indicates the impact of sentiment analysis of financial news on forecasting asset prices. In this research, sentiment is culled from financial news of companies over the past three years. Subsequently the asset prices can be predicted using stock market data, alongside sentiment analysis data with several machine learning algorithms. The results show a more convincing level of precision in the aggregation of both stock market data and sentiment analysis data.

This research was completed in Summer 2020 CIS REU with Mingchen Xu (Shanghai International Studies University), Yiran Huang (Nankai University), and Mulei Xu, under the mentorship of Professor Patrick Houlihan at Columbia University. Our published paper is available [here](https://www.airitilibrary.com/Article/Detail/P20200813001-202107-202107160001-202107160001-265-276).
