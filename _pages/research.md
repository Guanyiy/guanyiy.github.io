Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on several research projects that span statistics, cognitive science, and global health. These experiences have strengthened my skills in data wrangling, statistical modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration ‚Äî and deepened my curiosity for using data to answer real-world questions.

I‚Äôm currently working with Professor Emily Briceno at the University of Michigan, where our team focuses on cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cross-cultural neuropsychological assessment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. My role includes data cleaning, variable harmonization, modeling cognitive outcomes, and navigating the complexities of large, multi-country studies.

More details on past and current projects are listed below. Stay tuned ‚Äî I‚Äôm always exploring new directions.



### üêÅ Digital Cages Behavioral Data Analysis (with [Prof. Ivo D. Dinov](https://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/ivo-d-dinov) and Dr. [Simeone Marino](https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/2984/simeone-marino) ) 

**Overview:**  
This project explores high-resolution **actigraphy data** collected from mice housed in ‚Äúdigital cages‚Äù ‚Äî an automated platform that passively captures movement-based behavioral patterns. Our aim is to identify **distinct activity profiles** and uncover **latent behavioral states** under varying experimental conditions.

**My Contributions:**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed large-scale time-series datasets, including timestamp alignment, sensor noise filtering, and missing value imputation  
- Applied **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) to visualize behavioral trajectories across individuals  
- Performed **unsupervised clustering** (k-means, hierarchical) to identify natural groupings in activity patterns  
- Integrated **feature selection pipelines** using the NExOS algorithm for downstream supervised learning and behavioral prediction  

**Skills/Tools:** R, Python, data wrangling, PCA/UMAP, clustering, time-series analysis, scientific visualization  


## Parking Functions and Unit Interval Parking Functions with Fixed Ascent and Descent Sets

**Abstract:** We recall that unit interval parking functions of length $n$ are a subset of parking functions in which every car parks in its preference or in the spot after its preference, and Fubini rankings of length n are rankings of $n$ competitors allowing for ties. We present an independent proof of a result of Hadaway, which establishes that unit interval parking functions and Fubini rankings are in bijection. We also prove that the cardinality of these sets are given by Fubini numbers. In addition, we give a complete characterization of unit interval parking functions by determining when a rearrangement of a unit interval parking function is again a unit interval parking function. This
yields an identity for the Fubini numbers as a sum of multinomials over compositions. Moreover, we introduce a generalization of Fubini rankings, which we call the $r$-Fubini rankings of length $n + r$. We show that this set is in bijection with unit interval parking functions of length $n + r$ where the first $r$ cars have distinct preferences. We conclude by establishing that these sets are enumerated by the $r$-Fubini numbers.

## Determination of Average Time that A Particle Escapes from a Channel with Diverse Parameters

**Abstract:** As a particle bounces within a macroscopic billiard table, microstructures affect the frequency of output angles. There also exists a connection between macrostructures and microstructures, both of which determining particle behavior, which we quantify as the mean escape time. In the case of a microstructure that introduces specular diffuse collision law, the mean escape time is reminiscent of martingales and optional stopping theorem. With triangular microgeometry, the output angles are finite. We begin to construct the transition matrix which models the behavior of these output angles, and define the ways in which the angles transform within the triangular cells.

This research was completed at Summer 2021 REU at Mount Holyoke College with Ruozhen Gong and Emily Rosaci, under the mentorship of [Professor Timothy Chumley](https://tchumley.mtholyoke.edu/?_ga=2.98059675.564660943.1704846727-1838912408.1704846727). Our group wrote a [final report](https://tchumley.mtholyoke.edu/pdf/Summer_2021_research_report.pdf) and built an [R-shiny app](https://olypys-yuxuan-wang.shinyapps.io/Billiards_Probability_and_their_Interplay/) to showcase our results.

## Leveraging Financial News Analysis to Predict Stock Price Movement

**Abstract:** Stock market predictions have been prominent among scholars. Sentiment analysis applying financial news articles for predicting stock has also grown in popularity over the past few decades. Our research indicates the impact of sentiment analysis of financial news on forecasting asset prices. In this research, sentiment is culled from financial news of companies over the past three years. Subsequently the asset prices can be predicted using stock market data, alongside sentiment analysis data with several machine learning algorithms. The results show a more convincing level of precision in the aggregation of both stock market data and sentiment analysis data.

This research was completed in Summer 2020 CIS REU with Mingchen Xu (Shanghai International Studies University), Yiran Huang (Nankai University), and Mulei Xu, under the mentorship of Professor Patrick Houlihan at Columbia University.
